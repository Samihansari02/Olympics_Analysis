# Olympics Data Analysis Web App
A fully interactive data analysis dashboard built using Streamlit and Pandas that explores 120+ years of Olympic history. This project visualizes medal counts, athlete demographics, sports trends, and country-wise performance — all in one streamlined web app.


## Project Description
This project allows users to explore the official Olympics dataset (1896–2016) through a responsive web app. It was built to demonstrate how Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) can be made interactive and accessible using Python, Streamlit, and real-world datasets.
Due to GitHub's file size limitations, the large dataset files are dynamically loaded via Google Drive when the app runs.


## Key Features
- Medal Tally – View medal counts by country or year
- Country-wise Analysis – See how a country has performed over time
- Athlete Insights – Filter athletes by age, gender, event, and medals
- Overall Trends – Track growth in participation, sports, and events
- Interactive Visualizations – Built with Plotly, Seaborn, and Matplotlib
- Streamlit Cloud Ready – Hosted online for public access


## Dataset
This app uses the publicly available Kaggle Olympic History dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results
athlete_events.csv – Athlete performance data
noc_regions.csv – National Olympic Committees region mapping

Due to file size (>100MB), CSVs are not included in the GitHub repo and are loaded using Google Drive.
